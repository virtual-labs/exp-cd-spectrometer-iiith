**Module1 :**

Step1 : Click on the regulator of the N2 gas cylinder to open the gas for purging.

Step2 : Click on the knob present on the cylinder to control the flow rate of N2 gas according
to short wave length limit of measurement.

Step3 : After setting the flow rate now turn on the CD spectrometer by clicking the green button present on the left side of the machine.

Step4 : Now turn on the computer by clicking the CPU power button.

Step5 : Now turn on the water bath by clicking on the power button and set the temperature to 20°C for normal measurement.

Step6 : Now turn on the peltier temperature control(PTC) to regulate the temperature and stirrer revolution for the sample by clicking the power button.After turning on PTC, click the start button to activate the PTC. The PTC has two mode:

(i)Stirrer mode:Regulate the stirrer revolution rate by scrolling the slider present on the PTC.

(ii)Temperature mode:Regulate the temperature of the sample by clicking the Ctrl and +/- arrow keys.
After setting the stirrer revolution rate and temperature click on the Enter button.

Step7 : Now click on the lid of the CD spectrometer,the instrument will now undergo its initialization process. Once the initialization is completed, the lid will open and the lamp will be turned on.

Step8 : After the initialization of the CD spectrometer now it is ready for the spectrum measurement.

**Module2 :**

Step1 : First click on beaker ,then on the sample solution to bring it to the table.

Step2 : Then pour the sample solution into the beaker.

Step3 : Click on the pipette to bring it to the experiment table, then click the pipette to fill it with the sample solution.

Step4 : Now click on cuvette to bring it to the experiment table,and then click the pipette to fill the solution into the cuvette.

Step5 : Now click the cuvette to place into the cuvette holder of the CD spectrometer.

Step6 : Now the scan will take place and the spectrum for the sample will be recorded.The detail process of the modulation and the detection of the CD signal is shown in the simulated diagram.
